notes: |
  - Queen bed (1500x2000) centered leaves 390mm each side for bedside cabinets
  - Bedside cabinets (300mm deep) are flush with bed when lowered
  - Remaining gap: 390 - 300 = 90mm clearance between bed and cabinet face
  - Lift mechanism options: Happiack, Bedlift, or custom
  - When lowered: bed surface ~1060mm from floor, access from sides
  - When raised: full standing room below for dinette use
  - Safety: locking mechanism at both positions essential
  - Consider manual backup if electric fails
