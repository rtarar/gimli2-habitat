notes: |
  - Multi-function structure: storage + bed support + seating base
  - Hatch tunnel provides through-access without going outside
  - Top surface at 860mm from floor = comfortable bench height
  - When lift bed lowers, it rests on this ledge
  - Dinette cushions on top double as part of bed support
  - Consider internal dividers for organized storage
  - Ventilation slots may be needed to prevent moisture buildup
  - Structural requirements: must support bed + 2 people (~200kg)
