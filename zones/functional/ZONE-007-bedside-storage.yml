  # CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:
  # Hatches (HATCH-01/02): center at 500mm from rear, 600mm wide → 200-800mm from rear
  #   - Hatches are BELOW garage shell (center_y=430mm), so nightstands on top don't block them
  # Windows (WIN-01/02): center at 1200mm from rear, 1063mm wide → 668-1732mm from rear
  # Bed: 2000mm long from rear wall
  #
  # NIGHTSTAND DESIGN:
  # - Rear face: AT rear wall (0mm from rear)
  # - Front face: WHERE window starts (668mm from rear)
  # - Depth: 668mm (fills gap between rear wall and window)
  # - Sits ON garage shell (860mm) up to bed surface (1120mm)
  # - Hatches below are not blocked (they're at 155-705mm height)

  DESIGN CHANGES (2025-01-21):
  - Lower cabinets REMOVED - were blocking hatches and extending to floor
  - Replaced with NIGHTSTANDS that sit ON TOP of garage shell (860mm)
  - Nightstands are flush with bed surface (1120mm) when bed is lowered

  NIGHTSTAND GEOMETRY:
  - Rear face: AT rear wall (0mm from rear)
  - Front face: WHERE window starts (668mm from rear)
  - Depth: 668mm (spans from rear wall to window)
  - Width: 300mm (flush with bed edge at 390mm from wall)
  - Height: 260mm (860mm garage top to 1120mm bed surface)

  HATCH CLEARANCE:
  - Hatches (HATCH-01/02) are at center_y=430mm (155-705mm height range)
  - Nightstands sit at 860-1120mm height (ON TOP of garage shell)
  - Hatches are BELOW the nightstands - no conflict

  NIGHTSTAND FEATURES:
  - 300mm wide x 668mm deep x 260mm tall (each side)
  - Open top or shallow drawer for phones, glasses, books
  - USB-A and USB-C charging ports
  - Cable management grommets for AC adapters
  - At headboard end where heads rest

  UPPER CABINETS (unchanged):
  - Above window zone (1435mm to ceiling)
  - Full 2000mm depth (bed length)
  - 725mm tall (1435 to 2160)
  - Clothing or general storage

  VOLUME CALCULATION:
  - Nightstands: 2 x (0.3 x 0.668 x 0.26) = 0.104 m³
  - Upper cabinets: 2 x (0.3 x 2.0 x 0.725) = 0.87 m³
  - Total: ~0.97 m³
