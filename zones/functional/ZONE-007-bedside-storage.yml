  driver_side_cabinet:
    width: 300    # mm (depth from wall)
    depth: 2000   # mm (matches bed length)
    height: 2160  # mm (floor to ceiling)
    position:
      from_driver_wall: 0     # mm - against wall
      from_rear_wall: 0       # mm - starts at rear

      Against driver wall, behind/beside bed.
      Gap to bed: 390 - 300 = 90mm clearance when bed lowered.

notes: |
  - Total storage volume: 2 x (0.3 x 2.0 x 2.16) = 2.59 m³
  - Shallow depth (300mm) maximizes floor space
  - 90mm gap between cabinet face and bed edge when lowered
  - Middle zone at 860-1300mm is prime nightstand height
  - Consider interior LED strips that activate on door open
  - USB charging ports at nightstand level (both sides)
  - Lower zone accessible when bed raised (for day use)
  - Upper zone accessible always (above bed travel height)
  - Soft-close hinges prevent noise at night
