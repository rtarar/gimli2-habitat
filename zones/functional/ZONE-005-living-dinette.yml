notes: |
  - U-shape: rear bench (on garage shell) + two side benches
  - Rear bench at 860mm (garage shell height) - higher than side benches
  - Side benches at 450mm - standard dining height with 720mm table
  - Height difference creates interesting tiered seating
  - Table must be removable/foldable for bed lowering
  - Consider swivel table mount or folding wall-mount
  - Side bench storage: shoes, gear, misc
  - When bed lowers, cushions may need adjustment or stay in place
  - Seating capacity: 4-5 people comfortably
