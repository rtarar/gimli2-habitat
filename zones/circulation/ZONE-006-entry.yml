notes: |
  - Entry door on passenger side, bathroom immediately adjacent
  - Corridor width: 2280 - 800 (bath) = 1480mm at narrowest
  - After bathroom: full width available for kitchen/living access
  - Door swings outward, so interior clearance is for standing/turning
  - Consider entry mat for dirt/moisture
  - Shoe storage near entry prevents tracking through habitat
  - Emergency egress: door is primary, windows are secondary
