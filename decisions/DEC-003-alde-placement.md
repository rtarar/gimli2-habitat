## Decision: Alde Heating System Placement

**ID:** DEC-003
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** PROPOSED

## Context
The user has decided to prioritize Axle-Centered placement for Water and Batteries.
- **Batteries:** Driver Side Mid-Ship (Under Dinette).
- **Water:** Split Mid-Ship (Kitchen & Dinette).
- **Alde Constraint:** "Alde is not the heavy one... We can run it under the chassis."

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Rear Garage / U-Bench (RECOMMENDED)
**Description:** Place Alde in the **Rear Garage Shell (Driver Side Arm)** at ~X=500.
**Pros:**
- **Space:** The Batteries/Water have moved FORWARD to the axle (X=2380), leaving the Garage Shell (X=0..600) **EMPTY** and available!
- **Distribution:** Consolidates mechanicals in the rear.
- **Heating:** Ideally located to heat Bed and Dinette.
**Cons:**
- **Chassis Routing:** Requires coolant lines from engine to rear.

### Option 2: Front Bathroom Vanity
**Description:** Original proposal.
**Status:** Valid but less optimal for heating distribution.

## Decision
**Select Option 1:** Place the Alde unit in the **Rear Garage Shell (Driver Side)**.

## Rationale
Since the heavy Batteries and Water Tanks have moved mid-ship to the axle (X=2380), the Garage Shell volume (X=0 to 600) is now **vacant**. This is the perfect spot for the lightweight Alde heater. It reclaims the rear volume for useful systems without affecting the specific gravity balance significantly (only 15kg).

## Status
PROPOSED - Awaiting final confirmation.
